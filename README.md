# BEAM
BEAM is a desktop-based personalised, sporting application which allows its users to analyse
their physical activity (ranging over many sports) all by simply uploading GPX format files at the
click of a button. This application is inspired by the likes of Strava, MapMyRide, and GPXSee.
The user chooses a sport, uploads a GPX file, and is met with unique metrics and graphs for
each corresponding type of activity.
